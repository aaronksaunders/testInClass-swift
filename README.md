# testInClass-swift
--------
This is a swift port of an application I have written for a course on cross-platform mobile development at Howard University.

The application is currently written in Appceletor Titanium, and can be found [here](https://github.com/aaronksaunders/testInClass). It will also be ported to Ionic Framework since those are the two frameworks I am teaching in the class.

The application covers
* User Authentication
* Maps and Geo-Location
* Working with Table Views
* Working with the Camera
* Working with REST based APIs

This solution includes three third-party libraries
* [HanekeSwift](https://github.com/Haneke/HanekeSwift) - for image caching
* [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - Simplified http client
* [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) - working with JSON in Swift 
* [MBProgressHUD](https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD) - showing progress indicators
